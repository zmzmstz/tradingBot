This project aims to develop an automated cryptocurrency trading bot that operates on the Binance Testnet. Using Python and various technical analysis indicators such as Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD, the bot will analyze market trends and execute trades based on predefined strategies. The bot is designed to function autonomously, placing buy or sell orders for selected cryptocurrencies like BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT with fake money. Through backtesting and simulated trades, the bot’s performance will be evaluated to optimize trading efficiency and risk management. This project provides hands-on experience in algorithmic trading and market data analysis, preparing users for real-world financial markets.
